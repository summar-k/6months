            <h1>Hi Favio!</h1>
            <p>
                Can you believe it's been 6 months? 
                 Well it's basically been a year since everything started.. 
                 Time really flew by with you hehe. 
                 I'm so glad I got to know you and find out how amazing you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've created so many memories together like when we went to 
                Canes, Hangry Joes, Mini Golf, Lantern Festival, Rollerskating I could go on lol there's a lot. 
                 Anyway, being with you has taught me a lot about myself and you. 
                 You help me be a better person and I hope I can do the same for you!
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to spend much more time with you in the future. 
                 I love you so so so much!!!
            </p>
